BY SPECIFYING ACCEPTANCE BELOW, THE LICENSEE WARRANTS THAT HE/SHE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSENTS TO BE BOUND BY IT.   BY INSTALLING, ENABLING OR USING PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE ELECTS TO BECOME A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT THROUGH LICENSEE'S OWN FREE CHOICE. IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE WILL NOT SPECIFY ACCEPTANCE BELOW, AND MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

EVEN BALANCE, INC. RESERVES ALL RIGHTS NOT SPECIFICALLY GRANTED HEREIN.

Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable license (the "License") to use PunkBuster software only for non-commercial entertainment purposes. Licensee may not disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, redistribute (in any form), create derivative works of, or modify PunkBuster software, or any part thereof, in any way. Licensor reserves the right to terminate the License at any time and for any reason, or no reason at all, and without notice to Licensee. Additionally, upon breach of any term of this Agreement, the License granted under this Agreement shall automatically terminate without any additional notice to Licensee. Upon termination of the License, Licensee shall destroy all copies of PunkBuster software in Licensee's possession, including, without limitation, removal of all copies from magnetic media or other storage owned or controlled by Licensee.

Licensee acknowledges that PunkBuster software is owned by Even Balance, Inc.  Licensee agrees not to remove, deface or alter any copyright notices, or other evidences of ownership, as contained on or in PunkBuster software.

Licensee acknowledges that PunkBuster software is optional and is not a requirement in any respect for using or enjoying games that integrate PunkBuster software technology. Licensee also acknowledges and agrees that PunkBuster software is self-updating, which means that future updates will, from time to time and without any notice, automatically be downloaded and installed as a normal and expected function of PunkBuster software. Licensee consents to this automatic update function. Licensee further acknowledges and accepts that PunkBuster software may be considered invasive. Licensee understands that PunkBuster software inspects and reports information about the computer on which it is installed to other connected computers and Licensee agrees to allow PunkBuster software to inspect and report such information about the computer on which Licensee installs PunkBuster software. Licensee understands and agrees that the information that may be inspected and reported by PunkBuster software includes, but is not limited to, devices and any files residing on the hard-drive and in the memory of the computer on which PunkBuster software is installed.  Further, Licensee consents to allow PunkBuster software to transfer actual screenshots taken of Licensee's computer during the operation of PunkBuster software for possible publication. Licensee understands that the purpose and goal of PunkBuster is to ensure a cheat-free environment for all participants in online games. Licensee agrees that the invasive nature of PunkBuster software is necessary to meet this purpose and goal. Licensee agrees that any harm or lack of privacy resulting from the installation and use of PunkBuster software is not as valuable to Licensee as the potential ability to play interactive online games with the benefits afforded by using PunkBuster software.
 
Licensee agrees not to export or re-export into any country subject to U.S. trade sanctions or to which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to any nationals or residents of such countries unless such nationals are permanent residents of a country that is not subject either to such sanctions or embargoed goods. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE IN A COUNTRY OR LOCALE WHERE SUCH ACTION WOULD VIOLATE ANY LAW OR ORDINANCE. To the extent applicable, the United States Government shall only have those rights to use PunkBuster software as expressly stated and expressly limited and restricted in this Agreement, as provided in 48 C.F.R. §§227.7201 through 227.7204 inclusive.

This Software License Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas and applicable United States federal law. Exclusive venue for all litigation regarding this Agreement shall be in Harris County, Texas. Licensee agrees that any portion of this Agreement found to be invalid or unenforceable shall be modified, to the extent allowed by law, so as to allow for the enforcement of the original intended meaning of the portion found to be invalid or unenforceable.
 
PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AND WITHOUT LIMITATION, THAT IT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THAT IT IS MERCHANTABLE. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT IT WILL MEET LICENSEE'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OR DESIRES. LICENSEE AGREES THAT NEITHER EVEN BALANCE, INC., ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, LICENSORS, BUSINESS PARTNERS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ID SOFTWARE, INC.), SUCCESSORS NOR ASSIGNS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM WHATSOEVER INVOLVING PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE IN ANY WAY. FURTHERMORE, SHOULD ANY VERSION OF PUNKBUSTER SOFTWARE, INCLUDING FUTURE VERSIONS, PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY WAY, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE ENTIRE COST, IF ANY, OF LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY TYPE AND TO ANY DEGREE. THIS WARRANTY DISCLAIMER SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LICENSE IS TERMINATED BY EVEN BALANCE, INC. OR LICENSEE.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee and supercedes any prior statements, whether written or oral.
